# Zauberer - an interactive battle story-game, told with python
============================================

It was designed as a terminal (bash, VS Code, whichever) game, and so the best experience is accessing it through that avenue.

But you should be able to double-click the main game file and get a servicable rendition, albeit less colorful, visually.

How to use it
---------------------
If using from terminal:

1. From the game's main folder, enter 'python zauberer.py', then press enter (or 'python3 zauberer.py' if running a machine where multiple versions of python are installed)

2. This should load the game; music too should be heard

3. Read each line carefully to ensure you are making the decisions you actually want

4. Enjoy!
